## Problem we are solving with CRāV
  Searching for a restaurant can be a daunting task, but with CRāV we've made that search a little easier. By filtering restaurants by genre, the user can decide on a food genre (Italian, American, Mexican, etc) and our app will then display corresponding restaurants and their locations on a map. 

## Who is this App for?
  CRāV is for anybody that has ever had a difficult time picking a restaurant. Anybody who has even been paralyzed by indecision while looking for a place to eat, this is for you. 

## Elevator pitch
  CRāV is an app that will help indecisive foodies select a place to eat.
